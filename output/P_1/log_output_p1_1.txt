PTB-INFO: Disconnecting from kernel driver instance #0 for detected Intel GPU for safety reasons. setenv('PSYCH_ALLOW_DANGEROUS', '1') to override.
PTB-INFO: Running on OSX 10.9+ - Enabling protection against AppNap and other evils.
PTB-INFO: Retina display. Enabling panel fitter for scaled Retina compatibility mode.


PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Apple OS X, under Matlab 64-Bit (Version 3.0.12 - Build date: Dec 19 2014).
PTB-INFO: Support status on this operating system release: OSX 10.10 Supported.
PTB-INFO: Type 'PsychtoolboxVersion' for more detailed version information.
PTB-INFO: Most parts of the Psychtoolbox distribution are licensed to you under terms of the MIT License, with
PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: Always using Cocoa for fullscreen windows to work around graphics driver bugs in OSX.
PTB-INFO: Presentation timing precision is not yet known for this configuration on most machines. Check your results.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is Intel Inc. :: Intel Iris OpenGL Engine :: 2.1 INTEL-10.6.33
PTB-INFO: Renderer has 1536 MB of VRAM and a maximum 1536 MB of texture memory.
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1600 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO: Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback: Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.639528 ms [60.097859 Hz]. (60 valid samples taken, stddev=2.178778 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

WARNING: Couldn't compute a reliable estimate of monitor refresh interval! Trouble with VBL syncing?!?


----- ! PTB - ERROR: SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that synchronization
of Psychtoolbox to the vertical retrace (VBL) is not working on your setup.

This will seriously impair proper stimulus presentation and stimulus presentation timing!
Please read 'help SyncTrouble' for information about how to solve or work-around the problem.
You can force Psychtoolbox to continue, despite the severe problems, by adding the command
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script, if you really know what you are doing.
